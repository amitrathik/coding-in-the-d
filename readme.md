# Coding in the D

A blog to share stories and my experiences of navigating the city of Detroit to find a place to setup shop for the day.

My immediate plan is to streamline my development process by using tools I am most comfortable configuring. 

So, I will most likely use WordPress, but I plan on using my own custom theme. 

I'm interested in maybe using a headless WP Setup.

I will likely host the website on a VM hosted on Linode.
